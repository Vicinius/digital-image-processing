# crop-rotate-negative.py

shows basic image manipulation, being crop, rotate and negative the main ones

# histogram-equalization.py 

applies the process of histogram equalization to a low contrast image, which by image processing theory will make the low local contrast higher, as histogram equalization tends to improve contrast by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity values (peaks of low contrast in this case) as you can see on previous x new histogram (after equalization)

# log-filter.py

this applies the logarithym filter on an image, pixel by pixel using the for loop. this process tends to raise the brightness levels of a darker image. on the other hand, if you have a high brightness image and wants to lower it, you should use the inverse log filter
