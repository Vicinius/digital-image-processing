# mean-filter.py

applies the "cv2.filter2D" function from OpenCV module, which basically runs a certain *mask* by the original image and makes the convolution operation on it. for testing it's using the mean filter, but it could be any of the possible filters for image processing. other way to do this is by hand, which i've done at filtering-borders/filtering-borders.py
