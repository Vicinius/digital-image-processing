# digital-image-processing
This repository contains some of the pratices that I made during PDIVC classes (processamento digital de imagens e visÃ£o computacional) at @IFES

It is a summary of what I've learned on digital image processing using mostly OpenCV Python lib (https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html)

Summary:
  * pratica01: loading an image and displaying it
  * pratica02: splitting RGB channels, converting RGB to grayscale using different methods, binary images
  * pratica03: image manipulation, histogram equalization, logarithym filter
  * pratica04: other filters, like mean and laplace
  * pratica05: binary thresholding, webcam input and skin segmentation/detection using color information
  * pratica06: canny border detector and harris corner detector
  * EXTRA: **filtering-borders** ---> image filtering using for loops and not the already existing function

Some visual examples:
